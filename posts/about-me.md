## Building a Life, One Debug at a Time

Hey there. I’m glad you stopped by.

This blog is part digital garden, part journal, and part back-of-the-napkin sketchpad. I created it to track what I'm learning(or unlearning), thinking (or overthinking), and building (professionally and personally). It’s mostly about tech and career growth, but life doesn’t always keep to separate folders. So you’ll occasionally find posts about parenting, mental health, and those big, messy questions we all wrestle with.

### Who I Am (Right Now)

I'm a husband and father of four. That means my life is equal parts chaos and joy, often in the same moment. I work as a software engineer and have spent the last seven-plus years writing Java, Kotlin, and Spring-based applications, while also building out frontends with React. I’ve worked across domains, but I’m especially drawn to mission-driven spaces like healthcare, education, and public service.

I’m also a curious, ADHD-powered learner with a deep love for puzzles,whether they're code bugs, cryptic board games, or figuring out how to help my kids navigate their own complex little worlds.

Beyond the screen, I love reading, hiking, paddle boarding (badly but joyfully), coaching youth sports, and listening to music, especially hip hop, which to me is just poetry with a beat and a backbone, or trying to answer one of my kids’ wildly philosophical bedtime questions. *Spoiler: I rarely have a good answer, but I am great at making it up.*

### What I’m Trying to Do/Become (AKA, The Big Picture)

Right now, I’m working on building a non-anxious life rooted in reality, connection, and curiosity. One where I can show up fully, live with more intention, a greater sense of freedom and mindfulness, and create space for growth, healing, and just enough chaos to stay interesting.

Professionally, I’m growing into roles that let me stay close to code while allowing me to influence systems and people, even if I’m not managing a team directly. My career goals include becoming a senior engineer, a developer productivity engineer, a solutions architect, or a developer advocate. I want to help build better systems and better teams. That might mean writing tools that reduce developer toil, mentoring teammates through gnarly debugging sessions, or sharing hard-won lessons through writing, talks, or some other form. I’m especially drawn to meaningful work in healthcare, government technology, and education.

I’m not chasing prestige or recognition, I’m chasing meaning and impact. Ideally, in a place where I can make a difference and still show up for my people.

### My Guiding Principles

At the core of my work and life are a few things that keep me grounded:

Values: Curiosity, compassion, simplicity, empowerment through knowledge, and a deep love of learning new things.

Tools I Use to Make Sense of the World: Code, writing, teaching, systems thinking, storytelling, and humor.

Driving Questions:

- How can I use technology to make people’s lives better?
- How can I simplify something complex so others can understand it too?
- How do I help people think more clearly, creatively, and confidently?

### Why This Blog Exists

Because writing helps me think. Because our work (and our lives) deserve documentation explicitly as stories. Because I believe knowledge compounds but only when it's shared. I’ve learned so much from the people who took the time to write things down, and now it’s my turn to give back. And, honestly, because sometimes I need a place to process the lessons that haven't quite synthesized yet.

This blog is for the builders, the overthinkers, the under-sleepers, the ones who care deeply and try hard (even when they’re exhausted). It’s a space for me to think out loud, laugh at myself, and leave a breadcrumb trail for whoever’s coming next. Whether you're here for the tech tips or the human stuff, I hope you find something useful, encouraging, or at least mildly entertaining.

Thanks for stopping by. Let’s keep building something meaningful, together.
